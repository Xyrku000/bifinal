This is the final project I completed for my Business Intelligence class.
At a fictional trucking company, Backroads Bulletin, I was tasked to solve three problems using business intelligence: low customer demand, low customer volume, and high fuel prices. In SQL Server management Studio, first designed and generated a database full of strings and numbers produced by encoded expressions. Each table related truck, fuel, customer, route, and transaction data at varying levels of detail and breadth. Using Tableau, I then created simple line graphs exposing the trends of the relevant variables and analyzed the resulting information. Finally, I recommended to the company that their relocation to Alliance, NE was a poor business decision, and that a more workable headquarters might be found in Scottsbluff, a nearby city. See the PowerPoint presentation attached for the details I shared to my classmates orally.
